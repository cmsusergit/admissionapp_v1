# Admin User Guide

This guide is for System Administrators responsible for the overall configuration, user management, and maintenance of the University Admission System.

## 0. Initial Project Setup (For IT/DevOps)

If you are deploying this system to a **brand-new Supabase project**, follow these steps to initialize the database and create your first administrator account.

### A. Initialize Database Schema
1. Open your terminal in the project root.
2. Locate your new Supabase project's PostgreSQL connection string (found in Supabase Dashboard > Settings > Database > URI).
3. Run the master setup script to create all tables, policies, and triggers:
   ```bash
   node scripts/setup_new_db.js "postgresql://postgres.[YOUR-PROJECT-REF]:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-eu-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres"
   ```

### B. Create the First Admin User
Once the database is initialized, you need a way to log in. Use the provided utility script to securely create the first system administrator.

1. Ensure your `.env` file contains the URL and Service Role Key for the *new* project:
   `NEW_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-new-project.supabase.co"`
   `NEW_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your-service-role-key"`
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   node scripts/create_admin_user.js "admin@university.edu" "SecurePassword123!" "Super Admin"
   ```
3. You can now log into the web interface using these credentials.
