# Documentation: Receipt Sequence System Fix

This document outlines the root cause and proposed resolution for the non-sequential "random" receipt numbers (e.g., `REC-1775...`) observed in the application fee system.

## 1. Root Cause Analysis

### The Conflict
There is a fundamental mismatch between the database schema constraints and the application logic in `src/lib/server/receipt.ts`.

1.  **Database Constraint:** The `receipt_sequences` table has a unique constraint `UNIQUE (college_id, payment_type, academic_year_id)`. This means the database expects only **one** sequence counter per college, fee type, and year. It does **not** consider the course.
2.  **Application Logic:** The SvelteKit backend tries to manage sequences **per course**. It fetches/creates sequences using `college_id`, `academic_year_id`, **and** `course_id`.
3.  **The Result:** When a student from a different course (e.g., Mechanical) tries to pay an application fee after a student from Computer Engineering has already paid, the code tries to insert a *new* sequence record for Mechanical. The database blocks this because a record for that `college_id` and `application_fee` already exists.

### The Fallback (Random Numbers)
When the sequence creation/lookup fails due to the above conflict, the system executes a **safety fallback**:
```typescript
if (createError) {
    console.error('Error creating receipt sequence:', createError);
    return `REC-${Date.now()}`; // Fallback to timestamp
}
```
This is why users see long, timestamp-based numbers like `REC-1775192122828` instead of sequential ones like `APP-26CS-0005`.

## 2. Proposed Fix (To be implemented)

### Step 1: Database Schema Update
Modify the unique constraint on `receipt_sequences` to include the `course_id`. This allows each course to maintain its own independent counter as intended by the code.

```sql
ALTER TABLE public.receipt_sequences 
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS receipt_sequences_unique_scope;

ALTER TABLE public.receipt_sequences 
ADD CONSTRAINT receipt_sequences_unique_scope 
UNIQUE (college_id, course_id, academic_year_id, payment_type);
```

### Step 2: Code Update
Update the lookup logic in `src/lib/server/receipt.ts` to explicitly filter by `payment_type`. This ensures that Application Fees do not increment the Tuition Fee counter and vice-versa.

```typescript
// Proposed update in generateReceiptNumber
let query = supabase
    .from('receipt_sequences')
    .select('id, current_sequence, prefix')
    .eq('college_id', collegeId)
    .eq('course_id', courseId)
    .eq('academic_year_id', academicYearId)
    .eq('payment_type', paymentType); // Missing in current code
```

## 3. Impact Assessment
*   **Existing Receipts:** This change will **not** affect receipts already issued. They will remain in the database with their current numbers.
*   **New Receipts:** Once applied, all new receipts will follow a strictly sequential pattern (e.g., `APP-26ME-0001`).
*   **Continuity:** Courses that already have a sequence record will continue from their last number. Courses that were previously failing (hitting the fallback) will start fresh from `0001`.
